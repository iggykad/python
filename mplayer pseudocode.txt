0.1 release

order of priority:
- pause/play V

- volume slider V

- loop (current song will restart when finished) <-----

- choose track to play V

- restart track [back] V 

- tab to view songs in queue

- play status playing/not playing V


0.1.1 play and pause works


0.1.2 minor bug fix
fixed a bug where the music continued playing even after program 
was exited (try except finally + separate functions for play_sound and stop_and_close)


0.1.3 minor addition
console now displays "now playing" when play button is pressed - wip to output this into the GUI


0.1.4 New label to display status (not playing/now playing)
plan: add a function that changes the label back to "not playing" when pause button is pressed.


0.1.4.1 Status label now shows which song is being played
future update: fix the bug which makes track reset every time a song is unpaused


0.1.5 play button is now disabled upon press to prevent playing the track a bunch of times with multiple presses


0.1.6 added a functioning volume slider for increased sound control


0.1.7 added functionality for a directory of audio files
plan: add skip button


plan for 0.1.8 large update:

Allow user to choose an mp3 file to load into the player
open file button, click, choose file, loads into file_index(?)


0.1.8 can now load an mp3 from file explorer

bugs:
- play button always prompts user to open a file (only open file button should do this)

0.1.9 as well as being loadable, the mp3 filename will now show in the label once you load them, 
as well as once you hit play
