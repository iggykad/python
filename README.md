this is my first genuine project I've been working on for around 2-3 months during work with the help of docs from all around the web as well as some minor fixes I couldn't do without ChatGPT yet
(e.g the volume control). i've uploaded a text file containing the "updates" from throughout these past months - probably syntactically sort of "wrong" in comparison to large-scale projects but 
thought it would be a fun thing to do
in addition to that it also contains what i'm planning to add in the future

in terms of features, you can add your own mp3 files to play, control volume, reset the song either by clicking play while it's already playing,
or the back button.

at the moment it only loads one song at a time but functionality to queue multiple songs (as well as display a queue window for upcoming tracks)
will be added when i learn exactly how to do that

oh and i've left 3 mp3s that i was using to test things out =)
